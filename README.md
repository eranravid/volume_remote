# volume_remote
This is a NodeJS + Unity Remote controller App to control your PC's volume from a phone app

# Usage
The defualt ip for the server is 127.0.0.1 but sometimes if you can't reach the server in LAN try to change the ip to your local net IP in the volume_controller.js.
You can navigate to the site in the browser and with the two parameters 'method' and 'vol' you can set the volume.
You can also use the android apk to install the unity app for better interface in mobile.
The execution of the volume change is done using nircmd which is a windows executer.
